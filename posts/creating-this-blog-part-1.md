# Prologue

Creating this blog has been a significant endeavor for me, driven by various factors despite the challenges of the past three years, including the impact of COVID-19. Throughout my journey, I grew disillusioned with frameworks like React, finding their functional concepts and state management capabilities insufficient. Additional dependencies like Redux and styled-components only added to the complexity.

# JavaScript frameworks: Odyssey to Chaos

Exploring alternative solutions such as Next.js, Vue, Angular, and Svelte, I encountered limitations and vendor lock issues, along with the need to learn specific directives and module management. However, my discovery of Nullstack brought newfound hope. Initially seen as heretical due to its utilization of ES6 classes and named methods for component cycles, I soon recognized its brilliance and potential.

Nullstack stands out for its simplicity, utilizing class props for streamlined data management instead of convoluted states. Its superior application context eliminates the need for a Redux store. Notably, Nullstack's built-in support for progressive web app (PWA) capabilities without additional dependencies surpasses the SEO capabilities of Next.js projects.

# Fine: the great solution

Moreover, Nullstack supports various application architectures, including single-page applications (SPAs), static HTML, and Node servers with Express. Its lack of vendor lock enables projects to run on diverse infrastructures, from on-premises to cloud-based environments.

In conclusion, my journey of creating this blog led me to discover Nullstackâ€”a solution that embodies simplicity and flexibility, allowing developers to leverage browser APIs without unnecessary complications. It has revitalized my appreciation for JavaScript. Stay tuned for Part 2, where I will delve deeper into my experiences and i demonstrate how i created the basic structure of this blog.
